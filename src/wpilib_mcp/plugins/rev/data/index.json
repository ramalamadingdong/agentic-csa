      "title": "SPARK MAX Control Interfaces",
      "section": "SPARK MAX",
      "language": "All",
      "content": "The SPARK MAX can be controlled by three different interfaces, servo-style PWM, controller area network (CAN), and USB. The following sections describe the operation and protocols of these interfaces. For more details on the physical connections, see Control Connections . PWM Interface The SPARK MAX can accept a standard servo-style PWM signal as a control for the output duty cycle. Even though the PWM port is shared with the CAN port, SPARK MAX will automatically detect the incoming signal type and respond accordingly. For details on how to connect a PWM cable to the SPARK MAX, see CAN/PWM Port . The SPARK MAX responds to a factory default pulse range of 1000µs to 2000µs. These pulses correspond to full-reverse and full-forward rotation, respectively, with 1500µs (±5% default input deadband) as the neutral position, i.e. no rotation. The input deadband is configurable with the REV Hardware Client or the CAN interface. The table below describes how the default pulse range maps to the output behavior. PWM Pulse Mapping If a valid signal isn't received within a 60ms window, the SPARK MAX will disable the motor output and either brake or coast the motor depending on the configured Idle Mode. For details on the Idle Mode, see Idle Mode - Brake/Coast Mode . CAN Interface The SPARK MAX can be connected to a robot CAN network. CAN is a bi-directional communications bus that enables advanced features within the SPARK MAX. SPARK MAX must be connected to a CAN network that has the appropriate termination resistors at both endpoints. Please see the FIRST Robotics Competition Robot Rules for the CAN bus wiring requirements. Even though the CAN port is shared with the PWM port, SPARK MAX will automatically detect the incoming signal type and respond accordingly. SPARK MAX uses standard CAN frames with an extended ID (29 bits), and utilizes the FRC CAN protocol for defining the bits of the extended ID: CAN Packet Structure ExtID [28:24] ExtID [23:16] ExtID [15:10] ExtID [9:6] ExtID [5:0] Device Type Manufacturer API Class API Index Device ID Each device on the CAN bus must be assigned a unique CAN ID number. Out of the box, SPARK MAX is assigned a device ID of 0. It is highly recommended to change all SPARK MAX CAN IDs from 0 to any unused ID from 1 to 62. CAN IDs can be changed by connecting the SPARK MAX to a Windows computer and using the REV Hardware Client . For details on other SPARK MAX configuration parameters, see Configuration Parameters . Additional information about the CAN accessible features and how to access them can be found in the SPARK MAX API Information section. Periodic Status Frames The SPARK MAX sends data periodically back to the roboRIO. Frequently accessed data, like motor position and temperature, can be accessed using several APIs. Data is broken up into several CAN \"frames\" which are sent at a periodic rate. This rate can be changed manually in code, but unlike other parameters, this setting does not persist through a power cycle. The rate can be set anywhere from a minimum 1ms to a maximum 32767ms period. The table below describes each status frame and its available data. Periodic Status 0 - Default Rate: 10ms Available Data Description Applied **** Output The actual value sent to the motors from the motor controller. The frame stores this value as a 16-bit signed integer, and is converted to a floating point value between -1 and 1 by the roboRIO SDK. This value is also used by any follower controllers to set their output. Faults Each bit represents a different fault on the controller. These fault bits clear automatically when the fault goes away. Sticky Faults The same as the Faults field, however the bits do not reset until a power cycle or a 'Clear Faults' command is sent. Is Follower A single bit that is true if the controller is configured to follow another controller. Periodic Status 1 - Default Rate: 20ms Available Data Description Motor Velocity 32-bit IEEE floating-point representation of the motor velocity in RPM using the selected sensor. Motor Temperature 8-bit unsigned value representing: Firmware version 1.0.381 - Voltage of the temperature sensor with 0 = 0V and 255 = 3.3V. Current firmware versions - Motor temperature in °C for the NEO Brushless Motor. Motor Voltage 12-bit fixed-point value that is converted to a floating point voltage value (in Volts) by the roboRIO SDK. This is the input voltage to the controller. Motor Current 12-bit fixed-point value that is converted to a floating point current value (in Amps) by the roboRIO SDK. This is the raw phase current of the motor. Periodic Status 2 - Default Rate: 20ms Available Data Description Motor Position 32-bit IEEE floating-point representation of the motor position in rotations. Periodic Status 3 - Default Rate: 50ms Available Data Description Analog Sensor Voltage 10-bit fixed-point value that is converted to a floating point voltage value (in Volts) by the roboRIO SDK. This is the voltage being output by the analog sensor. Analog Sensor Velocity 22-bit fixed-point value that is converted to a floating point voltage value (in RPM) by the roboRIO SDK. This is the velocity reported by the analog sensor. Analog Sensor Position 32-bit IEEE floating-point representation of the velocity in RPM reported by the analog sensor. Periodic Status 4 - Default Rate: 20ms Available Data Description Alternate Encoder Velocity 32-bit IEEE floating-point representation of the velocity in RPM of the alternate encoder. Alternate Encoder Position 32-bit IEEE floating-point representation of the position in rotations of the alternate encoder. Periodic Status 5 - Default Rate: 200ms Available Data Description Duty Cycle Absolute Encoder Position 32-bit IEEE floating-point representation of the position of the duty cycle absolute encoder. Duty Cycle Absolute Encoder Absolute Angle 16-bit integer representation of the absolute angle of the duty cycle absolute encoder. Periodic Status 6 - Default Rate: 200ms Available Data Description Duty Cycle Absolute Encoder Velocity 32-bit IEEE floating-point representation of the velocity in RPM of the duty cycle absolute encoder. Duty Cycle Absolute Encoder Frequency 16-bit unsigned integer representation of the frequency at which the duty cycle signal is being sent. Use-case Examples Position Control on the roboRIO A user wants to implement their own PID loop on the roboRIO to hold a position. They want to run this loop at 100Hz (every 10ms), but the motor position data in Periodic Status 2 is sent at 20Hz (every 50ms). The user can change this rate to 10ms by calling: Pseudocode setPeriodicFrameRate(PeriodicFrame.kStatus2, 10); High CAN Utilization A user has many connected CAN devices and wishes to minimize the CAN bus utilization. They do not need any telemetry feedback, and have several follower devices that are only checked for faults. The user can set the telemetry frame rates low, and set the Periodic Status 0 frame rate low on the follower devices: Pseudocode leader.setPeriodicFrameRate(PeriodicFrame.kStatus1, 500); leader.setPeriodicFrameRate(PeriodicFrame.kStatus2, 500); follower.setPeriodicFrameRate(PeriodicFrame.kStatus0, 100); follower.setPeriodicFrameRate(PeriodicFrame.kStatus1, 500); follower.setPeriodicFrameRate(PeriodicFrame.kStatus2, 500); Faster Follower Bandwidth The user wants the follower devices to update at a faster rate: 200Hz (every 5ms). The Periodic Status 0 frame can be increased to achieve this. Pseudocode leader.setPeriodicFrameRate(PeriodicFrame.kStatus0, 5); USB Interface The SPARK MAX can be configured and controlled through a USB connection to a computer running the REV Hardware Client . The USB interface utilizes a standard CDC (USB to Serial) driver. The command interface is similar to CAN, using the same ID and data structure, but always sends and receives a full 12-byte packet. The CAN ID is omitted (DNC) when talking directly to the device. However, the three MSB of the ID allow selection of alternate commands: 0b000 - Standard command - CAN ID omitted (DNC) 0b001 - Extended command - USB specific All commands sent over USB receive a response. In the case that the corresponding CAN command does not receive a response, the USB interface receives an Ack command.

      "content": "Brushed/Brushless Mode - Motor Type Brushed and brushless DC motors require different motor control schemes based on the differences in their technology. It is possible to damage the SPARK MAX, the motor, or both if the appropriate motor type isn't configured properly. Brushed or brushless motor types can be configured using the Mode Button, CAN, and USB interfaces. Mode Button Configuration Follow the steps below to switch motor types with the Mode Button. It is recommended that the motor be left disconnected until the correct mode is selected. Use a small screwdriver, straightened paper clip, pen, or other small implement to press the button. Do not use any type of pencil as the pencil lead can break off inside the SPARK MAX. Connect the SPARK MAX to the main power, not just USB Power. The Status LED will indicate which motor type is configured by blinking yellow or blue for Brushed Mode or blinking magenta or cyan for Brushless Mode. Press and hold the Mode Button for approximately 3 seconds. After the button has been held for enough time, the Status LED will change and indicate the different motor configuration. Release the mode button. Please see the Status LED Patterns guide for information on how to identify the Motor Type configuration by the color of the Status LED! USB Configuration Follow the steps below to switch motor types with the USB and the REV Hardware Client application. Be sure to download and install the REV Hardware Client application before continuing. Connect the SPARK MAX to your computer using a USB-C cable. Open the REV Hardware Client and verify that the application is connected to your SPARK MAX. On the Basic tab, select the appropriate motor type under the Select Motor Type menu. Click Burn Flash and confirm the change. CAN Configuration Please see the API Information for information on how to configure the SPARK MAX using the CAN interface. Brake/Coast Mode - Idle Behavior When the SPARK MAX is receiving a neutral command the idle behavior of the motor can be handled in two different ways: Braking or Coasting . When in Brake Mode , the SPARK MAX will effectively short all motor wires together. This quickly dissipates any electrical energy within the motor and brings it to a quick stop. When in Coast Mode , the SPARK MAX will effectively disconnect all motor wires. This allows the motor to spin down at its own rate. The Idle Mode can be configured using the Mode Button, CAN, and USB interfaces. Mode Button Configuration Follow the steps below to switch the Idle Mode between Brake and Coast with the Mode Button. Use a small screwdriver, straightened paper clip, pen, or other small implement to press the button. Do not use any type of pencil as the pencil lead can break off inside the SPARK MAX. Connect the SPARK MAX to main power, not just USB Power. The Status LED will indicate which Idle Mode is currently configured by blinking blue or cyan for Brake and yellow or magenta for Coast depending on the motor type. Press and release the Mode Button You should see the Status LED change to indicate the selected Idle Mode. Please see the Status LED Patterns guide for information on how to identify the Idle Behavior configuration by the color of the Status LED! USB Configuration Follow the steps below to switch the Idle Mode between Brake and Coast with the USB and the REV Hardware Client application. Be sure to download and install the REV Hardware Client application before continuing. Connect the SPARK MAX to your computer using a USB-C cable.

With each motor shown on this page, REV Robotics performed the same dynamometer testing and analysis of the data collected. Absolute vs. Relative Data Absolute Values for a specification are determined independently of each similar motor made by other manufacturers. Each of the specifications are determined by a manufacturer's individual testing procedures and methods of analyzing test data. Relative Values for a specification are found by running the same test and analysis on a motor. While the values provided may not match a motor's listed Absolute Values for a given specification, this kind of data helps us compare the motors as fairly as possible.

      "language": "All",
      "content": "The SPARK MAX can accept data from encoders through both the Encoder Port and the Data Port on the top of the motor controller. Encoders have a different method of connecting to the SPARK MAX that depends on what motor you are using and what type of encoder it is. When preparing your encoders, be sure to set up your SPARK MAX correctly for the type of devices you are using. Incremental vs Absolute Encoders Incremental encoders measure a change in position as a mechanism rotates while absolute encoders will report an exact position at any time, including at startup. A common analogy to help with knowing the difference is that incremental encoders are like a stopwatch that measures a change in time and absolute encoders are like a clock where you can know exactly what time it is. With SPARK MAX Firmware Versions 1.6.0 and newer, absolute encoders are compatible with the SPARK MAX Data Port. How to Connect an Encoder To connect an encoder to your SPARK MAX, start by identifying what type of encoder you are using. Below is a flowchart to help generally identify the method you should use. Running a brushless motor, like the NEO and NEO 550, without the integrated encoder plugged into the SPARK MAX's Encoder Port can damage your motor. Absolute Encoders Absolute encoders will work with the default pinout of the SPARK MAX Data Port if the latest firmware has been installed. When using an absolute or duty cycle encoder it is recommended to use one of the following methods to connect your encoder to the SPARK MAX. Check out our documentation of the Through Bore Encoder. Through Bore Encoder (REV-11-1271) : Connect with Absolute Encoder Adapter (REV-11-3326) Other Absolute Encoder: Connect with SPARK MAX Data Port Breakout Board (REV-11-1278) Use the Data Port Pinout to match the signals from your encoder Absolute Encoders are only supported through the SPARK MAX Data Port at this time Absolute Encoder Wiring Examples Absolute Encoder Adapter Data Port Breakout Board Easily connect a Through Bore Encoder to your SPARK MAX with an Absolute Encoder Adapter and a 6-Pin JST PH Cable. For encoders that need a custom wiring harness, you can use the following solder pads on a SPARK MAX Data Port Breakout Board with any generic absolute encoder. Incremental Encoders If you are using an Incremental Encoder with a brushed motor you can plug your encoder into the SPARK MAX's front Encoder Port directly. If you are driving a NEO or NEO 550 brushless motor with your SPARK MAX, you will need to configure Alternate Encoder Mode to accommodate the additional encoder input from the Data Port. When using an incremental or quadrature encoder it is recommended to use one of the following methods to connect your encoder to the SPARK MAX. Check out our documentation of the Through Bore Encoder. NEO or NEO 550 Internal Encoder: MUST be connected to the SPARK MAX Encoder Port Through Bore Encoder (REV-11-1271) With brushless motor: Connect with Alternate Encoder Adapter (REV-11-1881) . You will need to configure Alternate Encoder Mode. With brushed motor: Connect to the Encoder Port Other Incremental Encoder With a brushless motor: Connect the encoder with SPARK MAX Data Port Breakout Board (REV-11-1278) . Use the Alternate Encoder Mode Data Port Pinout to match the signals from your encoder. You will need to configure Alternate Encoder Mode. With brushed motor: Connect to the Encoder Port with a 6-Pin JST Breakout Board (REV-11-1276) using the Encoder Port pinout With a brushed motor: Connect the encoder with SPARK MAX Data Port Breakout Board (REV-11-1278) or a similar custom cable. Use the Data Port Pinout to match the signals from your encoder. Incremental Encoder Wiring Examples Alternate Encoder Adapter Brushed Motor Data Port Breakout Board Easily connect a Through Bore Encoder to your SPARK MAX with an Alternate Encoder Adapter and a 6-Pin JST PH Cable. When using the Alternate Encoder Adapter make sure the switch is set to \"index\". A Through Bore Encoder, or any incremental encoder with the same pinout, can be plugged in directly to the SPARK MAX's Encoder Port. For encoders that need a custom wiring harness, you can use the following solder pads on a SPARK MAX Data Port Breakout Board with any generic incremental encoder. Receiving both Incremental and Absolute Encoder Feedback Receiving both Incremental and Absolute encoder feedback from a single encoder through the SPARK MAX directly is not currently supported. To do this you will need to wire the encoder directly to your roboRIO or robot controller. Using Limit Switches with an Encoder Currently, Limit Switch inputs are only supported when using an absolute encoder or an incremental encoder run through the SPARK MAX's Encoder port. Please note, the limit switch inputs cannot be used at the same time as an Alternate Encoder Mode. The limit switch pins are repurposed for the alternate encoder and are thus disabled.

      "language": "All",
      "content": "DC Motors consist of two major parts, the part that rotates, or the “rotor”, and the part that is stationary, or the “stator”. A DC motor uses these parts to convert electrical energy into rotational mechanical energy using electricity and permanent magnets. Two types of DC motors are used in FIRST Robotics Competition: Brushed DC Motors and Brushless DC motors. Both types are useful in various robot applications, and both have their trade-offs. Brushless vs. Brushed Motor Basics Operating a brushed DC motor is simple; provide DC electrical power and the motor spins. In a brushed motor, the rotor consists of electrical winding wires and the stator consists of permanent magnets. Since the electrical part is spinning, there needs to be a way to connect the external power wires to the spinning rotor. This is accomplished through conductive “brushes” that make contact with the stator, automatically sequencing the power to make the rotor spin. Brushes make it easy on us, but they produce extra friction which reduces the efficiency of the motor. Brushless DC motors don’t have brushes. They still have both electrical winding wires and permanent magnets, but the locations are flipped. The stator now consists of the electrical parts, and the spinning rotor consists of the magnets. This means there is no more brush friction within the motor, making a brushless motor more power-efficient. However, you can’t just give it DC power and expect it to spin. Without the brushes doing the sequencing for us, you must use a specialized motor controller that is designed for brushless motors to properly sequence the power and get the rotor spinning. The REV NEO Brushless Motor runs an 8mm keyed output shaft which allows for an easy transition from CIM-style brushed motors into brushless. Swap a set of NEO Brushless Motors into your drivetrain or use one in an elevator to save weight and maintain peak performance. When paired with the SPARK MAX, you can use the integrated hall-effect sensors to calculate incremental position or speed from the NEO. Key Terms Stall Torque Stall Current Free Speed Operating Voltage Stall Torque is measured when the motors RPM is zero and the motor is drawing its full Stall Current . This value is the maximum torque the motor is ever capable of outputting. Keep in mind the motor is not capable of outputting this torque for an indefinite period of time. Waste energy will be released into the motor as heat. When the motor is producing more waste heat than the motor body is capable of dissipating the motor will eventually overheat and fail. Stall Current is the maximum amount of current the motor will draw. The stall current is measured at the point when the motor has torque that the RPM goes down to zero. This is also the point at which the most waste heat will be dissipated into the motor body. Free Speed is the angular velocity that a motor will spin at when powered at the Operating Voltage with zero load on the motor’s output shaft. This RPM is the fastest angular velocity the motor will ever spin at. Once the motor is under load its angular velocity will decrease. Operating Voltage is the expected voltage that the motor will experience during operation. If a robot is built using a 12 volt battery the Operating Voltage of the motor will be 12 volts. When controlling the RPM of the motor the DC speed controller will modulate the effective voltage seen by the motor. The lower the voltage seen by the motor the slower it will spin. DC motors have a maximum rated voltage if this voltage is exceeded the motor will fail prematurely. The key metrics defined above are interrelated. Take some time to familiarize yourself with the definitions and how they connect together. General Application Information In order to ensure that an electric motor lasts as long as possible a few rules of thumb should be kept in mind: Smooth loading - large torque spikes or sudden changes in direction can cause excess wear and premature failure of gearbox components. This is only an issue when the torque spike exceeds the rated stall torque of the motor. When shock loading is necessary, it is best to utilize mechanical braking or a hard stop that absorbs the impact instead of the motor. Overheating - when a motor is loaded at near its maximum operating torque it will produce more waste heat than when operating at a lower operating torque. If this heat this allowed to build up the motor can wear out prematurely or fail spontaneously. Poorly supported output shaft , most motor output shafts are not designed to take large thrust forces or forces normal to the shaft. Bearings need to be used to support the axle when loads in these directions are expected. Previous Frequently Asked Questions Next NEO Vortex Last updated 1 year ago Was this helpful?",

      "content": "NEO Vortex What are some best practices for using the NEO Vortex in a build? NEO Vortex Tips and Tricks When seating your Vortex with a SPARK Flex or Solo Adapter make sure your have aligned the bullet connectors and data connectors. They should seat near completely with hand pressure then secured with screws. Do not over tighten. Do not over tighten the the shaft screw when using a Vortex Shaft. The Vortex is an outrunner, so make sure there are not wires or components that can touch the spinning rotor. If the Vortex is used in an application that you are not using a shaft screw, make sure cover the shaft opening on the top of the Vortex to prevent dust and debris from falling into the Vortex spindle. What Smart Current Limit should I set for my NEO Vortex? The default Smart Current Limit is 80A, which is acceptable for most applications when driven by a SPARK Flex however... We recommend utilizing our motor curves and specifications to help calculate what the best current to torque ratio for your application will be. SPARK Flex Are there any quick tips for getting the most from a SPARK Flex? SPARK Flex Tips and Tricks Be sure to clean the SPARK Flex's surface with compressed air and remove any dirt or metal debris from the surrounding wire connections. If particulates find their way into the wire connectors you may experience intermittent connection issues. Maintain sufficient wire management to avoid critical wires from being strained and ripped out. Before your team puts the robot on the field, give all wires one last smart tug to ensure everything is secure for the match. Remember to update your SPARK Flex to the latest firmware when connecting your robot through the REV Hardware Client. SPARK MAX What is your best advice for using a SPARK MAX? SPARK MAX Best Practices Ensure the firmware installed on your SPARK MAXs is the latest version! You can do this using the REV Hardware Client. Ensure you've set a proper Smart Current Limit for your motor and what it will be driving. Keep your wire management neat. Wires need to be protected and organized so they are can not be clipped by mechanisms or become an entanglement risk. Protect the SPARK MAX from debris and impacts. Use the included port covers or tape over the data port when not in use. Regularly inspect your SPARK MAX and its wires for a secure connection and damage. How do I run an encoder with the SPARK MAX? We have a documentation page that can help! Check out Using Encoders with the SPARK MAX ! My SPARK MAX isn't working, where do I start? Don't panic! Take a step back and assess the current situation. A good place to start isolating the root issue would be to go through our Troubleshooting - SPARK MAX documentation. What does the LED on my SPARK MAX indicate? The Status LED indicates the operation mode or fault status of your SPARK MAX See our reference table on the SPARK MAX Status LED Patterns to find the LED behavior that matches your SPARK MAX. Both color and speed of the blinking pattern are important to note! Should I change the factory default setting for Smart Current Limit? Your Smart Current Limit will depend on the motor being controlled and what it is driving. A new SPARK MAX's Smart Current Limit default setting is 80A, but may need to be less. We recommend utilizing our locked-rotor testing data or the table below to decide what to set your Smart Current Limit to for your robot: Locked-Rotor Testing for the NEO (REV-21-1650) and NEO 550 (REV-21-1651) . Generally, the following ranges work well: NEO V1.1: 40 A - 60 A NEO 550: 20 A - 40 A Can I run a NEO Vortex with a SPARK MAX? You will need to purchase one of our NEO Vortex Solo Adapters (REV-11_2828) Check out our documentation on the NEO Vortex Solo Adapter and the SPARK MAX for more information. Why don't the settings save on my SPARK MAX? Be sure to always click Persist Perimeters (formerly: Burn Flash) to save the settings through the REV Hardware Client! A SPARK MAX's parameters can also be overwritten within your code, so ensure you also burn flash after any changes in your program too. Any settings that had been modified and not persisted will reset when the SPARK MAX is power cycled. NEO V1.1 What are general best practices for the NEO V1.1? REV's NEO V1.1 Tips and Tricks Use care when removing the sensor wire from a SPARK MAX. Firmly gripping all 6 of the wires as close to the JST connector as possible and pulling evenly generally gives best results. If needed you can also use a small tool to pry or grab the plastic notches of the JST Connector. Periodically check the NEO's phase and data wires for noticeable damage to the wire insulation or connectors. Exposed wire on your robot runs the risk of a possible short to your system. Keep the NEO clear from any debris, especially those that could get caught in the mechanism it is driving or affect your wiring. Route all wires with proper strain relief to avoid damage or unintentional disconnects from tension. MAXPlanetary Gearbox Cartridges are pre-lubricated and sealed. If during maintenance you find that a cartridge needs more grease, we recommend using a Molybdenum Grease to apply more lubrication such as Synthetic NLGI #2 Molybdenum Grease or MOLYKOTE® G-2008 Synthetic Tool Gear Grease . What Smart Current Limit should I set for my NEO V1.1? Generally we recommend 40A - 60A But this setting will be dependent on the application you've assigned to the NEO v1.1. Is the motor acting as the main drive motor on a MAXSwerve Module? Or is it actuating the elbow on your arm mechanism? Please briefly reference our NEO Motor Locked Rotor Testing . Say for example you have four NEO v1.1s assigned as the main drive motors on MAXSwerve Modules for your robot, and the Smart Current Limit is set to 60A. If your robot is pushing against an object causing the NEO v1.1s to experience stalling, potential motor failure would occur at approximately 105 seconds due to the build up of thermal energy. Realistically, setting the Smart Current Limit to 20A and gradually increasing the amperage enough to break traction with the ground is adequate. Another example would be if you have one NEO v1.1, and your team has decided to set the Smart Current Limit past the recommended 60A for an arm mechanism. While the the motor is capable of preforming past 60A, if your arm mechanism is stuck on some game structure the window of motor failure is shorter than 105 seconds. How do I make a NEO V1.1 compatible with the new SPARK FLEX Motor Controllers? We have a solution coming soon! The SPARK Flex Dock will... The SPARK Flex Dock will allow a SPARK Flex to control any existing NEO or compatible brushless/brushed DC motor by converting it to a standalone motor controller! Stay tuned to our website for updates on its release! Can I run a NEO V1.1 on 24V? This is possible but we strongly recommend... Before running a NEO V1.1 at a 24V, we recommend first confirming that the motor controller that will drive it can also work at 24V as well. When a NEO is run at higher voltages, its specifications will also scale. All of the data listed on the product page and motor testing was run at 12V, so, when running a NEO at 24V you would need to double the values. For example: Free Speed @ 12V - 5676 RPM Free Speed @ 24V - 11352 RPM NEO 550 FAQ What are general best practices for the NEO 550? REV's NEO 550 Tips and Tricks Use care when removing the sensor wire from a SPARK MAX. Firmly gripping all 6 of the wires as close to the JST connector as possible and pulling evenly generally gives best results. If needed you can also use a small tool to pry or grab the plastic notches of the JST Connector. Periodically check the NEO 550's phase and data wires for noticeable damage to the wire insulation or connectors. Exposed wire on your robot runs the risk of a possible short to your system. Keep the NEO 550 clear from any debris, especially those that could get caught in the mechanism it is driving or affect your wiring. Route all wires with proper strain relief to avoid damage or unintentional disconnects from tension. UltraPlanetary Gearbox Cartridges are pre-lubricated and sealed. If during maintenance you find that a cartridge needs more grease, we recommend using a Molybdenum Grease to apply more lubrication such as Synthetic NLGI #2 Molybdenum Grease or MOLYKOTE® G-2008 Synthetic Tool Gear Grease . When pressing a pinion on your NEO 550 shaft, taken care to not over press the pinion or dislodge the motor's shaft. Take a look at our Pinion Pressing guide for assistance. What Smart Current Limit should I set for my NEO 550? Generally we recommend 20A - 40A But this setting will be dependent on the application you've assigned to the NEO 550. Is the motor being used as a steering motor on a swerve drive? Or is the motor being utilized to articulate a part of your intake? Please briefly reference our NEO 550 Motor Locked Rotor Testing Say for example you have four NEO 550s assigned as the steering motors on MAXSwerve Modules for your robot, and the Smart Current Limit is set to 40A. If field debris impedes your robot is from completing its turn causing the NEO 550 to experience stalling, potential motor failure would occur at approximately 27 seconds due to the build up of thermal energy. However, setting the Smart Current Limit to 20A increases this window to 220 seconds, which should withstand most stall encounters.

      "content": "Brake/Coast Mode - Idle Behavior When the SPARK Flex is receiving a neutral command the idle behavior of the motor can be handled in two different ways: Braking or Coasting . When in Brake Mode , the SPARK Flex will effectively short all motor wires together. This quickly dissipates any electrical energy within the motor and brings it to a quick stop. When in Coast Mode , the SPARK Flex will effectively disconnect all motor wires. This allows the motor to spin down at its own rate. The Idle Mode can be configured using the Mode Button, CAN, and USB interfaces. Mode Button Configuration Follow the steps below to switch the Idle Mode between Brake and Coast with the Mode Button. Use a small screwdriver, straightened paper clip, pen, or other small implement to press the button. Do not use any type of pencil as the pencil lead can break off inside the SPARK Flex. Connect the SPARK Flex to main power, not just USB Power. The Status LED will indicate which Idle Mode is currently configured by blinking blue or cyan for Brake and yellow or magenta for Coast depending on the motor type. Press and release the Mode Button. You should see the Status LED change to indicate the selected Idle Mode. Please see the Status LED Patterns guide for information on how to identify the Idle Behavior configuration by the color of the Status LED! USB Configuration Follow the steps below to switch the Idle Mode between Brake and Coast with the USB and the REV Hardware Client application. Be sure to download and install the REV Hardware Client application before continuing. Connect the SPARK Flex to your computer using a USB-C cable. Open the REV Hardware Client application and verify that the application is connected to your SPARK MAX. On the Basic tab, select the desired mode with the Idle Mode switch.

      "title": "SPARK Flex Troubleshooting",
      "section": "SPARK Flex",
      "language": "All",
      "content": "Many issues can be solved by systematic troubleshooting without needing to contact REV Support. Take a look at the troubleshooting tips below for help in determining the cause of the issue you are seeing. Should you need to contact us, describing the steps you've taken in detail will help us get you up and running quickly. General Troubleshooting Tips The key to effective troubleshooting is isolating the issue. Many issues can show the same symptom, so eliminating failure points one at a time is critical to finding the root cause. Rule Out Issues By Isolation If possible, try to eliminate a section of the system when troubleshooting. For example: Rule out a code or control wiring issue: Use the REV Hardware Client to run the SPARK Flex over USB. Please be aware of the CAN lockout feature of the SPARK Flex . If it has been connected to the roboRIO's CAN bus, a safety feature within the SPARK Flex will lock out USB communication. Disconnecting from the CAN bus and power cycling the MAX will release the lock. If this is your first time running the REV Hardware client, see the Getting Started with the REV Hardware Client for a tour of the software and its features. Rule out a code issue: Create a simple test program using our SPARK Flex Example Code. Rule out a mechanical issue: Remove the motor from the mechanism or use a different, free-spinning motor. Use the Driver Station An extremely useful set of tools can be found on the Driver Station: Use the Driver Station Log File Viewer Look at the PDP channel current draw: Higher than expected current on a channel can indicate both mechanical and electrical issues. Look at the battery voltage: Large dips in the battery voltage around the time of an issue can indicate battery health issues that cause brownouts. Use the CAN/Power Tab Look at the CAN Bus Utilization. Look at CAN Faults. Look at Comms Faults: Comms faults can affect the SPARK Flex. If it loses communication with the roboRIO, it will go to its safe disabled state. This can look like a momentary glitch in a motor spinning if the comms faults are infrequent and irregular. Use the APIs It is also very useful to log or plot operating values internal to the SPARK Flex. These values can be accessed using the SPARK Flex APIs. Useful values to log: getAppliedOutput() This value will show what the SPARK Flex is actually applying to the motor output. This can illuminate issues with closed-loop control tuning. getOutputCurrent() This value will show the output current going to the phases of the motor. Output current won't always be the same as the Input current measured by the PDP. Knowing the output current is useful to diagnose current-limit issues if motors are overheating. getBusVoltage() A way to measure the input voltage right at the controller. getStickyFaults() A sticky fault indicates if a fault has occurred since the last time the faults were reset. Checking these can provide a lot of insight into what the controller is experiencing. CAN Troubleshooting Recovery Mode Sometimes, when updating the firmware on a SPARK Flex, it is possible for the process to be interrupted or for the firmware to be corrupted by a bad download or other type of interruption in data transfer. In this state, the Status LED will be dark or dim and the device will fail to operate. There is a built-in recovery mode that can force your device to accept new firmware even if the controller seems to be bricked and the procedure is outlined below: Please note, that performing this procedure will erase all data and settings on the device. To perform the procedure a small tool, like a straightened paper clip, is necessary to press the Mode Button (located to the right of the Status LED), the orange USB-C cable that came with the unit (or a DATA capable USB-C cable), and a native Windows based computer with the REV Hardware Client installed: With the SPARK Flex disconnected from power, press and hold the Mode Button. While still holding the Mode Button, connect the Device to the computer using the USB-C cable - the Status LED will not illuminate - this is expected. With the REV Hardware Client running on the computer, wait a few seconds for the audible tone or icon for the device to be recognized in recovery mode then release the Mode Button - no lights will be present on the SPARK Flex during this stage of the process, this is expected. Select the SPARK Flex in Recovery Mode from the REV Hardware Client window. From the \"Choose a Device\" type dropdown, choose - SPARK Flex. Choose the latest version of the firmware from the dropdown and then click update. Wait for the software update to complete. Power cycle unit (unplug and plug in USB-C) click on the SPARK Flex icon, and clear any sticky faults - the recovery should be complete!

This can illuminate issues with closed loop control tuning. getOutputCurrent() This value will show the output current going to the phases of the motor. Output current won't always be the same as the Input current measured by the PDP. Knowing the output current is useful to diagnose current-limit issues if motors are overheating. getBusVoltage() A way to measure the input voltage right at the controller. getStickyFaults() A sticky fault indicates if a fault has occurred since the last time the faults were reset. Checking these can provide a lot of insight into what the controller is experiencing. Common Faults and Issues Below you will find some troubleshooting steps for some common faults and issues related to operating the SPARK MAX. Motor Not Spinning Gate Driver Fault Sensor Fault Powers via USB but not 12V Continuity Check Instructions Measure the continuity between each of the motor phase wires and the sensor wire, as pictured here. Also, check the resistance between wires of the sensor cable and motor wires. Reach out to [email protected] with results for each phase wire. Recovery Mode Sometimes, when updating the firmware on a SPARK MAX, it is possible for the process to be interrupted or for the firmware to be corrupted by a bad download or other type of interruption in data transfer. In this state, the Status LED will be dark or dim and the device will fail to operate. There is a built-in recovery mode that can force your device to accept new firmware even if the controller seems to be bricked and the procedure is outlined below: Please note, performing this procedure will erase all data and settings on the device. To perform the procedure a small tool, like a straightened paper clip, is necessary to press the Mode Button (located to the right of the Status LED), the orange USB-C cable that came with the unit (or a DATA capable USB-C cable), and a native Windows based computer with the REV Hardware Client installed: With the SPARK MAX disconnected from power, press and hold the Mode Button While still holding the Mode Button, connect the Device to the computer using the USB-C cable - the Status LED will not illuminate - this is expected. With the REV Hardware Client running on the computer, wait a few seconds for the audible tone or icon for the device to be recognized in recovery mode then release the Mode Button - no lights will be present on the SPARK MAX during this stage of the process, this is expected Select the SPARK MAX in Recovery Mode from the REV Hardware Client window From the \"Choose a Device\" type dropdown, choose - SPARK MAX Choose the latest version of the firmware from the dropdown and then click update Wait for the software update to complete Power cycle unit (unplug and plug in USB-C) click on SPARK MAX icon, clear any sticky faults - the recovery should be complete!

      "content": "Anderson Powerpole connectors are a popular choice in the FIRST community for electrical connections. Ensuring that these connectors are crimped properly and the contact is fully inserted into the housing is key to having a good electrical connection. Anderson Powerpole Connectors consist of two major parts: the housing and contact. There are a number of different housings and contacts depending on the power requirements of the system. The most common housing and contact used with the SPARK MAX is the 1327 series housing paired with the 45 amp contacts. Anderson Connector Housing The housings for the connectors are genderless allowing all powerpole connectors to mate with themselves. The 1327 series housing can utilize contacts rated for 15-45 amps. Housings come in a variety of colors allowing for easy pairings with the wire color. Dovetails on each housing allow them to slide together. Do not attempt to snap the housings together as they can break. After the housings are mated together adding a roll pin prevents the housings from become detached during operation. Each housing is fitted with a spring to retain the contacts after they are inserted Anderson Contacts 1327 series housings can use contacts rated for between 15 and 45 amps. The 45 amp contacts are used with the SPARK MAX. When striping wire for the contact, make sure the stripped wire is the length of the large flap. No wire should extend past the large flap into the gap between the large and small flaps on the contact. Utilize a proper crimping tool when crimping on the connector. Having too much wire exposed can cause issues with proper placement of the contact in the housing. This can lead to bad connections. If the contacts are not fully inserted into the housing the contact connection issues can arise. The images above are examples of good crimps with the proper amount of wire inserted into the contact. Having improper placement of the contact in the housing can lead to intermittent brownouts of the SPARK MAX, the contact dislodging from the housing, or have cause problems with one or more of the phases of a brushless motor.

Additionally, the following basic operating modes can be configured with the MODE button located on the top of the SPARK MAX: Idle Behavior : Brake/Coast Motor Type : Brushed/Brushless Mode configuration must be done with power applied to the SPARK MAX. Configuring the idle behavior and motor type using the mode button is a quick way to set up a SPARK MAX without using a computer. This is most useful when you are controlling the SPARK MAX through its PWM interface or when testing the affect of Braking or Coasting on a mechanism. Idle Behavior Whenever the SPARK MAX receives a neutral signal (no motor movement) or no signal at all (robot disabled), it can either brake the motor or let it coast. When in Brake Mode, MAX will short the motor wires to each other, electrically braking the motor. This slows the motor down very quickly if it was spinning and makes it harder, but not impossible to back-drive the motor when it is stopped. With power turned on, press and release the MODE button to switch between Brake and Coast Mode. The Status LED will indicate which idle behavior mode it is in. See the Status LED Colors and Patterns section for more information. Motor Type It is very important to have the SPARK MAX configured for the appropriate motor type. Operating in Brushed Mode with a brushless motor connected will permanently damage the motor! With power turned on, press and hold the MODE button for approximately 3 - 4 seconds.

      "content": "Required Materials 12V Battery 120A Circuit Breaker Power Distribution Panel SPARK MAX Brushed or Brushless Motor USB Type-C Cable Prepare the Components Test Bed Using a test bed is an easy way to get started with using the SPARK MAX and verify connections and code. For the initial bring up of the SPARK MAX a test bed with a single SPARK MAX, a brushless or brushed motor, and a properly wired Power Distribution Panel with breaker is recommended. Electrical Connections The power and motor wires are permanently connected to the SPARK MAX and are not replaceable. So take care not to cut these wires too short. It is highly recommended to install connectors on these wires to simplify both the power and motor connections. A common connector used for this purpose is the Anderson Power Pole connector. Follow our Anderson Power Pole guide for tips on how to properly crimp these connectors. Make sure the power is disconnected or turned off before making any electrical connections on your test bed or robot. Connect the integrated SPARK MAX power leads labeled V+ (red) and V- (black) to an available channel on the Power Distribution Panel. If you need to extend the length of the integrated wires, it is recommended to use 12AWG wire or larger (lower gauge number). Motor Connections The first step is determining the type of motor you wish to connect. The SPARK MAX supports two types of motors: brushed DC and brushless DC. An easy way to determine the motor type is to look at the number of primary (larger) motor wires. Brushed motors only have 2 primary motor wires, while brushless motors have 3 primary wires and additional smaller sensor wires. NEO Brushless Motor Connections Connect the three motor wires; red, black, and white, to the matching SPARK MAX output wires labeled A (red), B (black), and C (white). Next connect the NEO or NEO 550's encoder cable to the port labeled ENCODER just above the output wires. The encoder sensor cable is required for the operation of brushless motors with SPARK MAX. The motor will not spin without it. Brushed DC Motor Connections Connect the two motor wires, M+ (red) and M- (black), to the SPARK MAX output wires labeled A (red) and B (black). The third output wire, labeled C (white), is not used when driving a brushed motor and should be secured and insulated. We recommend tying it back with a zip-tie and covering the end with a piece of electrical tape. Do not cut this wire in case you wish to use a brushless motor in the future. In the example below the extra unused motor wire is insulated by the white connector and secured in the block. Verify Connection Carefully check all connections before continuing and verify that all colors match. The SPARK MAX can be permanently damaged if the power connection is reversed. Leave the CAN cable disconnected for now, we will wiring this up later. Previous SPARK MAX Getting Started Next Make it Spin! Last updated 1 year ago Was this helpful?",

You should see the SPARK MAX slowly blinking its for a new device the color will be Magenta. If the LED is dark, or you see a different blink pattern, refer to the Status LED guide for troubleshooting. If you are using a brushed motor, you may see a sensor error. This is expected until you configure the device to accept a brushed motor in the following steps. Connect to the SPARK MAX Plug in the USB cable and start the REV Hardware Client. Select the SPARK MAX from the Connected Hardware. If you can not see the SPARK MAX, make sure that the SPARK MAX is not being used by another application . Then unplug the SPARK MAX from the computer and plug it back in. Basic Setup and Configuration Before any parameters can be changed, you must first assign a unique CAN ID to the device. This can be any number between 1 and 63. After setting a unique CAN ID, the user interface will refresh and allow you to change other parameters. Eventually you may set up a CAN network on your test bench or robot. Be sure each device on the network has a unique CAN ID. It is helpful to label each device with its ID number to aid in troubleshooting. Set the Motor Type If you are using a NEO or NEO 550, verify that the motor type is set to REV NEO Brushless , Sensor Type is Hall Effect , and the LED is blinking Magenta or Cyan. If you see a Sensor Fault blink code, make sure the encoder cable is plugged in completely. If you are running brushed motor, set the motor type to Brushed and the sensor type will change to Quadrature , and verify that the LED is blinking Yellow or Blue. Limiting Current There are two ways to protect your robot’s motors from electrical damage in high-current situations: Circuit Breakers and the SPARK MAX’s Smart Current Limit Setting. To protect your motors from currents that are too high, it is a best practice to limit your current both with the SPARK MAX’s Smart Current Limit and an appropriately rated circuit breaker. Circuit breakers, while an extremely important part of a robot's wiring and safety, are only designed to trip at a specific temperature, after a set amount of time, to protect the electrical system from fire or other electrical hazards. Due to this, we recommend setting a Smart Current Limit to protect your motors from damage due to high currents. The SPARK MAX Motor Controller includes a Smart Current Limit feature that can adjust the applied output to the motor to maintain a constant phase current. Out of the box, the SPARK MAX's Smart Current Limit default setting is 80A for any motor that you use. We recommend utilizing our locked-rotor testing data or the table below to decide what to set your Smart Current Limit to for your robot: Locked-Rotor Testing for the NEO (REV-21-1650) and NEO 550 (REV-21-1651) . Remember that some settings, like Smart Current Limit, must be burned to flash via code or the Hardware Client in order to be retained through a power cycle of the SPARK MAX. Suggested Current Limits Your ideal current limit may vary based on your specific application, but these values can be used as a starting point to reduce the chance of an overload on your motor as you begin tuning your specific mechanism's Smart Current Limit. Motor Type Current Limit Range NEO ( REV-21-1650 ) 40A - 60A NEO 550 ( REV-21-1651 ) 20A - 40A Warning: Setting current limits outside of the suggested ranges listed above may cause unintended overload and severe damage to components that are not covered by warranty. Save the Settings The settings must be saved for the SPARK MAX to remember its new configuration through a power cycle. To do this, press the Burn Flash button at the bottom of the page. It will take a few seconds to save, indicated by the loading symbol on the button. As of REV Hardware Client version 1.7.0, \"Burn Flash\" has been renamed to \"Persist Perimeters\"! Any settings saved this way will be remembered when the device is powered back on. You can always restore the factory defaults if you need to reset the device. Spin the Motor Before running any motor, make sure all components are in a safe state, that the motor is secured, and that anyone nearby is aware. FRC motors are very powerful and can quickly cause damage to people and property. Keep the CAN cable disconnected throughout the test. For safety reasons, the REV Hardware Client will not run the motor if the roboRIO is connected. If the roboRIO was connected, power cycle the SPARK MAX. To spin the motor, go to the Run tab, keep all of the default settings and press Run Motor. The setpoint is 0 by default, meaning that the motor is being commanded to idle (0% power). When you press Run you should see the LED go from slow blinking to solid, indicating that the motor is idling. Slowly ramp the setpoint slider up. The motor should start to spin and you should see a green blink pattern proportional to the speed you have set to the motor. Slowly ramp the slider down. The motor should spin in reverse, and you should see a red blink pattern proportional to the speed you have set to the motor. If you are unable to spin the motor, visit our troubleshooting guide .

Docking Materials Docking the NEO Vortex with the SPARK Flex is simple and only requires the following materials and tools: NEO Vortex Brushless Motor SPARK Flex Motor Controller Docking Hardware 4 - M3 x 25 mm Socket Head Screws (included with SPARK Flex) 2.5 mm Hex Key Docking Procedure Follow these steps to ensure a secure and proper docking: Ensure that power is disconnected from the SPARK Flex. Align the motor phase bullets between the NEO Vortex and SPARK Flex. Allowing the bullets to guide the two together, press the NEO Vortex and SPARK Flex together until their bodies meet. There may be a small gap between the motor and the controller opposite the bullets. This is normal. Insert the included docking screws into the counterbored Docking Screw Clearance Holes on the SPARK Flex. Using the 2.5 mm Hex Key, tighten the four screws evenly in a crisscross pattern until the screws are tight and secure. The screw heads should be sub-flush from the mounting face of she SPARK Flex. If you have a torque wrench, the ideal torque is 11.5 ±0.9 in-lb (1.3 ±0.1 Nm). DO NOT run the motor without the docking screws installed. These screws ensure a robust and secure electrical connection, and doing so may cause damage to the system. Undocking Procedure Follow these steps to undock the NEO Vortex and SPARK Flex: Ensure that power is disconnected from the SPARK Flex. Completely remove the four docking screws from the assembly. Gently pull the NEO Vortex and SPARK Flex apart until the bullets release. Try to maintain their relative orientation to each other while pulling them apart.

SPARK MAX Data Port Features Limit Switch Inputs SPARK MAX has two limit switch inputs that, when triggered, can independently prevent motion in both the forward and reverse directions. By default, when the pin for the corresponding direction is grounded, SPARK MAX will override any input commands for that direction and force the output into the neutral state. Input commands for the opposite direction will still be processed unless the corresponding limit signal is also triggered. The default polarity is compatible with Normally Open (NO) style limit switches, whose contacts are shorted together when the switch is pressed. The Limit Switch Inputs can be configured for the opposite polarity using the USB or CAN interfaces. When configured for the opposite polarity, Normally Closed (NC), the limit will be triggered when the pin is left disconnected from ground. In other words, connecting the pin to ground will release the limit. The following table shows these configurations in detail: Limit Switch Operation Quadrature Encoder Input The Quadrature Encoder Input on the Data Port is compatible with standard quadrature encoder signals, usually labeled as channel A, channel B, and Index. SPARK MAX shares these signals with the Encoder Port on the output side of the controller, therefore the Index signal is shared with the third brushless encoder signal C. When in Brushless Mode, these Data Port pins cannot be used with an external encoder. See Alternate Encoder Mode for information on how to configure the SPARK MAX to accept an alternative encoder source when running in Brushless Mode. When in Brushed Mode, an external encoder can be connected through either the Data Port or the Encoder Port. The SPARK MAX encoder signals are not pulled high internally. This is to ensure the maximum compatibility with different types of encoders. Analog Input The Analog Port on the SPARK MAX can measure voltages up to 3.3V with 12-bit resolution. The SPARK MAX Data Port Breakout includes a 5V to 3.3V amplifier circuit so that 5V signals can be sensed with the Analog Input pin. Analog input is supported on firmware versions 1.4.0 and newer. Multi-function Pin This pin is reconfigured when the SPARK MAX is configured in Alternate Encoder Mode. Power Rails The SPARK MAX Data Port can provide both 3.3V and 5V power to connected devices. Please check Data Port Specifications for details on the supply current capabilities of both rails. SPARK MAX Data Port Accessories Alternate Encoder Adapter Features The SPARK MAX Alternate Encoder Adapter ( REV-11-1881-PK2 ) enables the use of an alternative encoder source different from the default. This is especially useful when running one of the NEO Brushless Motors, as the default encoder port is occupied by the built-in NEO hall sensors.

Please see Connecting an Alternate Encoder for for more information. Connecting an Alternate Encoder Connecting an alternate encoder will likely require a custom wiring harness to connect the necessary encoder power, ground, and signals to the reconfigured Data Port.

Check out our documentation of the Through Bore Encoder. Another option is the SPARK MAX Data Port Breakout Board . This board can be used to wire an alternate encoder to the Data Port. The following table describes which pads on the breakout should be used for which signals coming from the alternate encoder.

Configuration Using the REV Hardware Client Using the REV Hardware Client, select your SPARK MAX, then navigate to the Advanced Tab and scroll to the Alternate Encoder parameter section. Enable the alternate encoder by setting the kDataPortConfig parameter to 'Alternate Encoder' via the drop down menu. You can also set the other Alternate Encoder parameters at this time. Configuring Using the SPARK MAX APIs If using the SPARK MAX APIs, the Alternate Encoder is automatically configured when the Alternate Encoder object is instantiated. An Alternate Encoder is created the same as a CANEncoder , either by directly using the constructor or calling GetAlternateEncoder() on a previously constructed CANSparkMax . Copy static constexpr int kCanId = 1; static constexpr auto kMotorType = rev::CANSparkMax::MotorType::kBrushless; static constexpr auto kAltEncType = rev::CANEncoder::AlternateEncoderType::kQuadrature; static constexpr int kCPR = 8192; // initialize SPARK MAX with CAN ID rev::CANSparkMax m_motor{kCanID, kMotorType}; /** * An alternate encoder object is constructed using the GetAlternateEncoder() * method on an existing CANSparkMax object. If using a REV Through Bore * Encoder, the type should be set to quadrature and the counts per * revolution set to 8192 */ rev::CANEncoder m_alternateEncoder = m_motor.GetAlternateEncoder(kAltEncType, kCPR); Currently, quadrature is the only available type of configuration for an alternate encoder. This is differentiated from the other types of encoder configurations available for an encoder connected through the front facing Encoder Port on the SPARK MAX. Configuration Conflicts Since the alternate encoder inputs and the default digital inputs are shared on the Data Port, the user cannot use both the alternate encoder and a digital inputs in code. Therefore, a std::invalid_argument (C++), IllegalArgumentException (Java), or an Error on the Error Out terminal (LabVIEW) will be thrown if a user tries to construct both types objects in code simultaneously. Closed-Loop Control The alternate encoder can be used with the different closed-loop control modes available on the SPARK MAX. The feedback device used by a CANPIDController must be set to use the alternate encoder through SetFeedbackDevice(). Copy /** * By default, the PID controller will use the Hall sensor from a NEO or NEO 550 for * its feedback device. Instead, we can set the feedback device to the alternate * encoder object */ m_pidController.SetFeedbackDevice(m_alternateEncoder); Initial Bring-up Unlike the built-in sensor on the NEO Brushless motors, the 'phase' of the alternate encoder is unknown to the SPARK MAX. Before enabling any closed-loop control, it is critical that the phase is configured correctly. To verify: Configure and connect the sensor as a quadrature alternate encoder, but do not run a closed-loop mode. Plot the output signal of the motor using GetAppliedOutput() and the output of the encoder using altEncoder.GetVelocity() . Confirm that the sensor is behaving as expected. This can be done on the SmartDashboard: frc::SmartDashboard::PutNumber(\"Alt Encoder Velocity\", m_alternateEncoder.GetVelocity()); frc::SmartDashboard::PutNumber(\"Applied Output\", m_motor.GetAppliedOutput()); Verify that the sign of the sensor is correct relative to the motor direction when driving it forward and backward. If it is not, the sensor must be inverted by calling altEncoder.SetInverted(true). Previous Absolute Encoders Next Securing the Encoder Adapters Last updated 1 year ago Was this helpful?",

Power and motor connections are made through the two sets of wires built into the SPARK MAX. The wires are 12AWG ultra-flexible silicone-coated wire. Each wire runs approximately 15cm from the end faces of the controller. Be sure to take care when cutting and stripping the wires as not to cut them too short. The figure below shows these connections in detail. SPARK MAX Motor Controller Power Connections As with any electrical component, make all connections with the power turned off. Connecting the SPARK MAX to a powered system may result in unexpected behavior an may pose a safety risk. Motor Output Motor output wires are labeled as A, B, and C with red, black, and white wires. Brushed motors must be connected to the A and B wires, while brushless motors must be connected to all three. It is critical that the order of the brushless motor wires match the SPARK MAX or the motor will not spin and could be damaged. Additional details are below. Motor Connections SPARK MAX cannot detect which motor type it is connected to. Be sure to configure the SPARK MAX to run the type of motor you have connected. See the Motor Type - Brushed/Brushless Mode section for more details on configuring the appropriate motor type. Power Input Power input wires are labeled as V+ and V- with red and black wires. The SPARK MAX is intended to operate in a 12 V DC robot system, however, it is compatible with any DC power source between 5.5 V and 24 V. DO NOT reverse V+ and V- or swap motor and power connections. Doing so will cause permanent damage to the SPARK MAX and will void the warranty. DO NOT exceed the maximum supply voltage of 30V. Doing so will cause permanent damage to the SPARK MAX and will void the warranty. When using high-current motors, it is recommended to use a power source that is capable of handling large surge currents, e.g. a 12V lead-acid battery. If the supply voltage drops below 5.5V the SPARK MAX will brown out, resulting in unexpected behavior. It is also highly recommended to incorporate a fuse or circuit breaker in series with the SPARK MAX between it and the power source to prevent exceeding the maximum current rating.

Basic Tab The Basic Tab is used to set the most common parameters for the Pneumatic Hub. You can also view and clear sticky faults here. Sticky Fault - an indicator there was a fault that will stay until the fault has been cleared manually. Operating your pneumatics system without a roboRIO Using the REV Hardware Client, you can completely operate and test your pneumatic system without needing a roboRIO or software. Here are some useful applications that can help your team: Testing your pneumatic system in a bench top setting Testing the pneumatic system on your robot without the need for software support (e.g. allowing your build team to test the pneumatics while your programmers are busy). Using pneumatics in your quick and early prototypes during the beginning of the build season Using the telemetry tab on the Hardware Client, you can see if you have leaks in your systems or check how much pressure you lose during normal operation without needing to write extra software.

      "title": "Using the Log Viewer",
      "section": "REV Hardware Client",
      "language": "All",
      "content": "When troubleshooting problems with the REV Control System log files provide indicators of what the status of the Control Hub or Expansion Hub were during an event. A look at the Robot Controller, WiFi log, or Updater log may help you better understand the root cause of the issue. However the logs document all activities that the Control System performs, not just issues, but normal startup procedures or op mode runs. The means that logs often contain more information than can be reasonably sifted through. To make the content in the logs more palatable to sort through, the logs need to be parsed. The REV Hardware Client has a Log Viewer that makes it easier to parse overall log files. Through a series of filters, tags, and a search function makes it easy to see what is happening on the Control Hub or Driver Hub during any opmode run. Accessing the Log Viewer To access the Log Viewer, head to the Utilities Tab. From there you can select and open log files for connected devices or for ones downloaded onto the computer. Parsing the Logs One of the most common issues that arises when trying to interpret logs is the wrong time and date on the Driver Hub or Driver Station phones. Ensuring that your Driver Station is set to the right time before observing or sending a log can help make data between the Robot Controller Log and Driver Station more interpretable. It also helps when observing a unique issue to pay attention to the time of the incident. If a problem or an indicator of a problem starts occurring at 4:38:57 PM then that time can be tracked in the logs to help determine what happened that initiated the issues. Once you have confirmed the correct date and time you can use the Log Viewer to try to track the problem within the logs. If you select a connected device, such as a Control Hub, the Log viewer will give you an option to select standard logs or matches. Matches are segments of the robot controller log where a particular op mode is running. This is helpful to parse the data further by limiting the content to particular op mode runs that you know a system failure occurred during. Interpreting Filters Aside from helping parse data down to specific time intervals the Log Viewer offers filters to select narrow down data in the logs to a particular type of data. The Log Viewer splits the data from the logs into six types: error, warning, info, fatal, debug, and verbose. Errors Errors occur when system actions do not execute properly. These log lines are typically indicative of a user created issues, such as errors in code, configuration, or wiring. For instance, in the image above the error is stating that it failed to calibrate the camera, which could be a sign that the USB Camera was detached from the Control Hub. Another common error you might see are compilation errors. These particular errors are the same error messages you receive in OnBot Java when you attempt to Build code and it fails. Warnings When something none fatal occurs in the system, the system sends warning messages. Instances that warrant a warning message, do not cause the Control System to fail, but may cause unexpected behavior. This could be a warning about mismatched versions between the Robot Controller and Driver Station applications, or a warning that your Control System is not receiving enough power to function. Info Info messages communication information that my be worthwhile to know for troubleshooting but not necessarily indicative of an issue. This is information like, when a program is initialized, started, or stopped. Fatal Like Errors, Fatal actions occur when something within the system does not execute properly. However, fatal actions are indicative that something more severe is happening in a system. If you are having an issues and notice a lot of instances of the fatal data type, please send your diagnostic data to REV, with information on the issue you are having and the status LED behavior. Debug The debug filter, showcases instances within the logs where debugging functions built into the SDK are performing their jobs. The Log Viewer defaults to filtering out debug information, as the information is typically not needed for troubleshooting. Verbose Many of the log types we have discussed thus far provide the insight needed to troubleshoot an issue. However, the logs track much more information than what falls in the other categories. The verbose log type covers the rest of the information included in the logs. This information is typically recording normal system behaviors that do not provide much insight to a problem.

Device Name: The name of the device and the randomly generated ID assigned to each device when connected to the REV Hardware Client. This is randomly generated each time the device is connected to the REV Hardware Client. Signal Value: The value recorded for each Signal Name. Record to .CSV This allows you to select an existing .csv file prior to starting your graph and record the data straight to the .csv file. This allows you export additional data to a previously exported telemetry file without headers to seamlessly add to your existing columns. Troubleshooting roboRio Lockout Please be aware of the CAN lockout feature of the ION Control System. If it has been connected to the roboRIO's CAN bus, a safety feature within all ION Control System Devices and will lock out USB communication. You may be able to change some parameters on select devices but in order to run motors through the telemetry tab disconnecting from the CAN bus and power-cycling the device will release the lock. PID Set Up Guide As of REV Hardware Client version 1.7.0, \"Burn Flash\" has been renamed to \"Persist Perimeters\"! Under the device list, select your SPARK motor controller. Click the \"Advanced\" tab. For a SPARK MAX, under the \"Alternate Encoder\" section, make sure \"kDataPortConfig\" is set to \"Default\". Under the \"Closed Loop\" section, set \"kCtrlType\" to \"Position\". Under the same section, set \"kFeedbackSensorPID0\" to \"Duty Cycle\". Click \"Burn Flash\" at the bottom of the page. (Burn Flash has been renamed to Persist Perimeters in v 1.7.0) To tune your PID gains, click the \"Telemetry\" tab. Set the \"Mode\" to \"Position\". Under the \"Signals\" tab, select \"Run Setpoint\" and \"Duty Cycle Position\". Click the \"Tuning\" tab. Begin tuning your PID gains! Note that the setpoint in Hardware Client only allows whole numbers, so it would be helpful to set the Duty Cycle Position Factor parameter to something like 360 for degrees. Frequently Asked Questions Do I need to use a special type of USB cable? You need to use a USB-A to USB-C cable data capable cable. The orange USB cable that comes with most ION devices fits this description. Does the SPARK Flex offer more options than the SPARK MAX? As of the 2024 FRC season the SPARK Flex and SPARK MAX offer the same options. New features will become available with future updates to the SPARK Flex that will be free to SPARK Flex owners forever. Can the units of the telemetry channels be changed? No, not at this time. We recommend exporting the data as a .csv file and converting to fit your specific needs.
