It can control both brushless (NEO, NEO 550) and brushed motors. Features include integrated encoder support, smart motion profiling, and CAN bus communication. The SPARK MAX supports REVLib for Java and C++ programming. It has built-in current limiting, temperature monitoring, and can run in various control modes including percent output, velocity, position, and voltage.",
