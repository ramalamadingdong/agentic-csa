      "content": "The Canandcoder is Redux Robotics' magnetic absolute encoder with CAN bus connectivity. It provides high-resolution absolute position feedback for mechanisms like swerve steering, arms, and turrets. Features include 14-bit resolution, 100Hz update rate, configurable zero offset, and velocity measurement. Communicates over CAN FD for low latency. The compact design fits in tight spaces. Use with ReduxLib in WPILib for easy integration.",

Configure zero offset with setAbsoluteOffset(). Set position frame period with setPositionFramePeriod() for update rate. Velocity available via getVelocity(). Configure settings in code or use Redux Hardware Client. Remember to reset after configuration changes.",

Features include high update rate, temperature compensation, and gravity vector output. Uses CAN FD for fast, reliable communication. Ideal for drivetrain heading control and mechanism angle tracking. Compact form factor for easy mounting. Integrates seamlessly with WPILib and PathPlanner. Use setYaw() to zero heading on robot enable.",
